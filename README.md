## Context & About

This repository was created in the summer of 2016 by [David Melisso](https://github.com/DJMcoder) to replace the old Harker Robotics website which was made using Wordpress. Although there were multiple robotics websites before that, they were mostly for the Purchase Request system and wikis. This repository created a combined location for an external website for outreach and an internal website for systems.

The website was updated in the summer of 2019 by [Chirag Kaushik](https://github.com/chiragzq) with a new design for the external facing website and a member attendence system.

The website uses [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) for backend and [Bootstrap 3.3](http://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/) + [JQuery](http://jquery.com/) for the frontend. More info can be found in [the Setup section](#setup). The new external facing website uses vanilla Javascript and CSS.

The website can be found at [robotics.harker.org](https://robotics.harker.org/) and is currently being maintained by [Kabir Ramzan](https://github.com/CMEONE) and [Aarav Borthakur](https://github.com/gadhagod).

## Setup

### Install mongoDB

Follow [this tutorial](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/install-community/) by mongoDB on how to install mongoDB onto your computer. For your reference, mongoDB is the database program used by this repository. Ensure that the `mongod` process is running before starting up the website. The tutorial explains how to run the `mongod` process.

### Install Node.js

First, go to [the Node.js download page](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). You will see two download links, download the one titled "LTS" or "Long Term Support".

As of January 8, 2018, this program works successfully on versions 7.4.0 and 8.9.0 of Node.js. In the future, this program should be updated to work successfully on future verisons of Node.js. You can check the version of node you are running by entering the command `node -v` into your terminal or command prompt.

### Duplicate config.json

In your file browser (Finder in macOS, File Explorer in Windows), locate the folder of this repository. Within the folder, copy the file `exampleconfig.json` and paste it as `config.json`. In the new file, change the value next to `superadmins` from `webmaster@example.org` to your Harker gmail address. Also, if you wish to run the internal parts of the website (Blog, PR's, etc.), you will have to contact the webmaster for Google API information (specifically, google.clientID and google.secretKey, and the blog API key if you wish to run the blog). The other values of the config file are explained in the [Config section](#configuration-values).

### Install packages

In your terminal (or command prompt), [change your working directory (`cd`)](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cd_(command)>) to the folder for this repository. Then, enter the command `npm install`. This uses the [node package manager](https://www.npmjs.com/) to install the packages required to run this program.

### Run the website

With your terminal's working directory still being that of the repository, enter the command `npm i` and then `npm start`. Then, go to `localhost` in your web browser. The website should appear.

## Folder Navigation

### /models

This folder contains the mongoDB models (using mongoose). [This tutorial](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/models.html) explains how to make models in Node.js using the `mongoose` package.

### /routers

The different express routers. They should be included (using `require`) in `index.js`. [This tutorial](http://expressjs.com/en/guide/routing.html) explains how routing works using the `express` package. Note that we are using routers, so instead of `app` you would use the variable `router`, which should be initialized using `express.Router()`.

If you are solely looking to work on the scouting app, this will either be part of the `member.js` code or be in a new file under `/routers/member/`.

### /static

The static files (images, css files, js files, etc.) which are accessed directly through the website. For example, if a file was placed in `/static/foo/bar/file.txt`, the file could be accessed on your device through `localhost/foo/bar/file.txt`. [This tutorial](http://expressjs.com/en/starter/static-files.html) explains how `express` handles statically served files.

### /views

The `ejs` files which store the front-end (HTML, rendered with `ejs`). Learn more about `ejs` [here](http://ejs.co/).

#### /views/pages

The actual pages that will be rendered and displayed. These files are displayed using `res.render()` in the `/controllers` folder.

Note that the scouting app page will be in `/views/pages/scouting.ejs`.

#### /views/partials

The snippets of HTML (may include `ejs`) which are included in the pages within `/views/pages`. They are included using `<%- include(__base + 'views/partials/example.ejs') %>`, except `example.ejs` would be replaced with the name of the file. This is good for snippets which are repeated, like navbars, footers, and `<head>` content.

## Configuration Values

The config file should be stored as `config.json`. You can copy from the example in `exampleconfig.json`. Make sure you understand how JSON works before manipulating the file. Here are the settings and what they mean:

## Code Style

Harker Robotics' apps use [@harker-robo/prettier-config](npmjs.com/package/@harker-robo/prettier-config) for standardized code style. To format your code:

    npm run format
